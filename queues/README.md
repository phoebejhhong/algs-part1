# Randomized Queues and Deques
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html
* Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

### Deque
* A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

### Randomized Queue
* A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure.

### Subset client
* Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of N strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once. You may assume that 0 ≤ k ≤ N, where N is the number of string on standard input.
